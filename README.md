# The Smart Female Individual Hygiene Solution
This proposal is to provide a female hygiene IoT solution which is to solve the problem that millions of African girls face with no access to safe feminine hygiene solutions and involve in the high infection risk. 

# The purpose
For a typical woman’s health cycle, menstruation is a natural part of the monthly routine, but for those who live in sub-Saharan Africa, it comes to a big problem and becomes their most dreaded time of the month. Because of hardly access to menstrual products, girls in sub-Saharan Africa often choose the rags, tree leaves, old clothes, toilet paper, newspapers, cotton wool as the substitute for the pads. Those girls are forced to miss school and susceptible to infections and other devastating consequences. Moreover, the culture in those places where women’s bodies are viewed as damaging social stigmas, leading to force them away from the support from the community and limit their job options and social interaction. Therefore, the lack of the female labor will inevitably cause the negative impact on socioeconomic, physical and mental toll on their lives.
